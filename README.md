### Aim: 
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
#### Procedure:
##### 1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:

Scenario:

The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.

Target Audience:

Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.

Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.

•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.

•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.

•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.

 
##### 2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
   
<b>Idea Generation Prompts:</b>

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:

•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.

•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.

•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.

•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

#### Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:

•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.

•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.


## Output:
Case Study 2: 
Designing an AI-Powered Automation System for Manufacturing

Objective : To design an AI-powered automation system for manufacturing industries that can:

Automate equipment control using IoT devices and embedded controllers

Enable predictive maintenance to minimize downtime

Provide real-time monitoring and remote control

Reduce energy consumption through process optimization

The system must deliver efficiency, reliability, and ease of use while keeping the operator interface intuitive and user-friendly.

Comparative Analysis Prompting

Here we test different prompting styles and compare outcomes.

#### a. Task-Oriented Prompt

Prompt Example:
“You are an automation assistant. Help manufacturing operators monitor machines, predict failures, and reduce downtime in a clear and concise way.”

Strengths: Efficient, quick responses for operators.

Weaknesses: May lack depth in explaining processes.

#### b. Persona-Driven Prompt

Prompt Example:
“You are a reliable and supportive factory automation assistant named ‘Optima.’ Guide operators with step-by-step advice on predictive maintenance, monitoring energy usage, and controlling machines remotely. Keep the tone friendly and easy to follow.”

Strengths: Builds trust, operator-friendly, reduces training needs.

Weaknesses: Risk of long responses, may slow urgent operations.

##### c. Comparative Analysis Outcome

Task-Oriented Prompt → Best for fast troubleshooting in urgent conditions.

Persona-Driven Prompt → Best for user engagement and long-term adoption.
➡️ Hybrid approach is recommended (speed + trust).

##### Universal Prompt Pattern

This approach creates one general prompt adaptable across use cases.

Prompt Example:
“You are an AI-powered automation system that: 
•  monitors machine performance in real time, 
• provides predictive maintenance alerts
• optimizes energy usage by switching equipment on/off as needed
• enables remote monitoring through cloud dashboards. Always respond in a clear, operator-friendly way.”

Advantages: Covers multiple functions in one design.

Disadvantages: May feel generic in complex industrial use cases.

#### Structured Prompt Refinements

We refine responses using structured guidance.

Structured Prompt Example:
“When assisting operators, follow this structure:

Provide real-time machine status update.

Highlight any predictive maintenance alerts.

Suggest optimization steps (energy/process).

Confirm whether remote action/control is needed.”

Advantages: Consistency, logical flow, improves operator decisions.

Disadvantages: May become repetitive in extended monitoring.

##### Prompt Size Limitations

Short Prompt (Minimal):
“You are a system that helps monitor and optimize machines. Be clear and efficient.”

• Fast response, easy to process

• Too vague for complex industrial needs

Long Prompt (Detailed Instructions): : Includes predictive models, safety protocols, escalation steps.

•  Rich in detail, very comprehensive

•  May cause delays and complexity in real-time monitoring

Finding Balance:Medium-sized prompts give the right balance: enough guidance for operators, without being too heavy.

###### Conclusion & Recommendations

Comparative Analysis: Hybrid approach (task + persona) is best.

Universal Prompt: Useful for baseline automation, but lacks customization.

Structured Refinements: Provide clarity and consistency for operators.

Prompt Size Limitations: Medium-length prompts are most effective.


# Result:
Thus the various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
